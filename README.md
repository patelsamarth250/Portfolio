## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, built with React, HTML, and CSS. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences. I've also integrated several libraries to enhance the user experience, including React Icons, SwiperJS, and EmailJS.

- **Contact Form:** Stay connected with your visitors through the integrated contact form powered by EmailJS. Receive messages directly in your inbox.

- **Modern Icons:** Utilize a wide range of icons for social media links and other elements, all thanks to the React Icons library.
